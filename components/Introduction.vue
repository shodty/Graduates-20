                | We are the Department of Design. We solve problems. We have a part in how we communicate
                | to and shape the world in which we live. This comes through the questions we ask of others and of
                | ourselves. Through image and word, form and color, texture and space our answers have a
                | substantial impact on how we live.
                | <br><br>
                | The disruption we are all working through is difficult. It is a loss to be cut off from working
                | directly with colleagues that have been held close for years while entering the final weeks of a
                | long journey. The moments of celebration to mark achievements have vanished but not the
                | achievements themselves.
                | <br><br>
                | With the support of some giving alumni and dedicated faculty, we have prepared this
                | celebration of our graduating seniors while acknowledging the moment we are all enduring.
                | This cannot replace the rather raucous celebration that is our annual spring show, but it can
                | reveal to the world the talent, dedication and achievements of our students as they move on to
                | the next step in their journey.
                | <br><br>
                | Thank you for taking the time to view this work. I encourage you to reach out and make new
                | connections for now or the future.

                | The Department of Design recognizes that the environments in which we live and work are shaped by an
                | ever-increasing quantity of visual information. This information
                | comes to us from a multitude of sources, utilizing both traditional and technologically advanced modes of visual communication.
                | To a greater extent than at any other point in our history, artists and designers are dissolving the boundaries between
                | two- and three-dimensional visualization.
                |<br><br>
                | The Department of Design is well positioned to respond to the multifaceted nature of todayâ€™s visual culture.
                | By offering degree programs in Graphic Design, Interior Architecture, and Photography we prepare our students
                | for a wide range of design practices that play a part in creating our built environment.
                |<br><br>
                | The Department of Design strives to prepare students to have an impact in professional creative environments
                | that will require collaboration, adaptation to technology and leadership in solving complex problems.
                | The needs of the institutions, businesses and individuals they work with are rapidly changing.
                | The technology they will use to create, as well as the technology used by their audiences is ever-changing.
                | We want graduates to be capable of seizing opportunities as they arise and turn them into meaningful learning experiences
                | throughout their career.
                |<br><br>
                |The Department of Design is where creative and critical thinking come together in a curriculum that,
                | while preparing students for different career paths, fully engages students in relevant areas of technical and aesthetic
                | concern while establishing historical and social context to their disciplines. Students are taught how to utilize an iterative
                | process to create high quality solutions that respond to complex functional and aesthetic requirements that correspond to the
                | appropriate audience, occupant or user.
                |<br><br>
                | Furthermore, the Department seeks to prepare students to be articulate in their discipline: to be able to discuss and present
                | their work, both in writing and in conversation, from the perspective of the functional and aesthetic concepts that underlay
                | the work and how their decisions in these areas frame and solve a given problem.
