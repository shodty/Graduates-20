                | We are the Department of Design. We solve problems. We have a part in how we communicate
                | to and shape the world we live in. This comes through the questions we ask of others and
                | ourselves. Through image and word, form and color, texture and space our answers have a
                | substantial impact on how we live.

                | The disruption we are all working through is difficult. It is a loss being cut off from working
                | directly with colleagues that have been held close for years while entering the final weeks of a
                | long journey. The moments of celebration to mark achievements have vanished but not the
                | achievements themselves. While acknowledging this loss we must remember as members of
                | the creative community our capacity to adapt to what is given and make something new.
                | <br>
                | <br>
                | With the support of some giving alumni and dedicated faculty we have prepared this
                | celebration of our graduating seniors while acknowledging the moment we are all enduring.
                | This cannot replace the rather raucous celebration that is our annual spring show, but it can
                | reveal to the world the talent, dedication and achievements of our students as they move on to
                | the next step in their journey.

                | Thank you for taking the time to view this work. I encourage you to reach out and make new
                | connections for now or the future.
